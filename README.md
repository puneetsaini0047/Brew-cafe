## About The Project

Brew Cafe is a comprehensive, client-facing website designed to provide a seamless and engaging digital experience for coffee lovers. This project demonstrates a strong command of front-end web development by combining a beautiful, responsive design with powerful, interactive features built purely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

From browsing the menu to placing an order, every step of the user journey has been carefully crafted. The highlight is a complete online ordering system where users can filter products, manage a shopping cart, and simulate a checkout process. To enhance user engagement, the site also includes an AI-powered chatbot, a dynamic testimonials slider, and a beautiful image gallery.
